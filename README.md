<a name="installation"> Installation </a>
--------------

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate `Punchcard` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'PinEntryView'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

In case Xcode complains (<i>"Cannot load underlying module for Punchcard"</i>) go to Product and choose Clean (or simply press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>).

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate `PinEntryView` into your project manually.

<a name="usage"> Usage </a>
--------------

`PinEntryView` is state based. To configure the view, simply update the state value with whatever values you'd like, and re-set the state:

1) First you should set up the `PinEntryView` and provide an initial state:

```swift
var pinEntryView = PinEntryView()
pinEntryView.state = PinEntryView.State(pin: "ACCEPT",
                                        allowsBackspace: true,
                                        showsPlaceholder: true,
                                        allowsAllCharacters: false,
                                        completedBorderColor: .green)
```

2) Once set, you can optionally adjust individual parameters in the state:

Reassigning one var can be done in line:
```swift
pinEntryView.state?.pin = "CONFIRM"
```

***or***

Group up reassigning multiple vars that way only one update (`PinEntryView.update()`) cycle is made:
```swift
var state = pinEntryView.state
state?.pin = "CONFIRM"
state?.showsPlaceholder = false
pinEntryView.state = state
```
